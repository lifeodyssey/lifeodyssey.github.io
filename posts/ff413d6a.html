<h2 id="light-detection-and-ranging">3.9 LIGHT DETECTION AND
RANGING</h2>
<p>Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is sometimes called “laser radar”
in an abuse of language because its principles are similar to those of
the radar systems that will be discussed later in this text.</p>
<p>LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that measures the
properties of scattered light to find the range or speed of distant
targets, or the backscattering and attenuation of volume targets such as
the atmosphere or the sea water.</p>
<p>As in radar systems, the range to an object is determined by
measuring the time delay between transmission of a (light) pulse and the
detection of the reflected signal. LIDAR technology was first used in
1962 by Fiocco and Smultin reflecting a laser beam off the surface of
the Moon and studying the turbidity in upper atmospheric layers.</p>
<p>Later, in 1963 it was used by Ligda to perform the first cloud height
and aerosols measurements.</p>
<p>LIDAR has seen applications in archeology, geography, geology,
geomorphology, seismology, remote sensing, and atmospheric physics.</p>
<h3 id="physics-of-the-measurement">3.9.1 Physics of the
measurement</h3>
<p>The main difference between LIDAR and radar is that LIDAR operates
with much shorter wavelengths of the EM spectrum, in atmospheric
transmission windows in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near-IR
(e.g., 0.4-0.7, 0.7-1.5, 3-5, and 9-13 mm)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lidar).</p>
<p>Thus, in general it is possible to detect a feature or object, which
is about the size of the wavelength or larger.</p>
<p>Thus, LIDAR is very sensitive to atmospheric aerosols and cloud
particles and has many applications in atmosphere research and
meteorology.</p>
<p>However, an object needs to produce a dielectric discontinuity to
reflect the transmitted wave.</p>
<p>At radar (microwave or radio) frequencies, a metallic object produces
a significant reflection. However nonmetallic objects, such as rain and
rocks produce weaker reflections and some materials may produce
nondetectable reflection at all, meaning some objects or features are
effectively invisible at radar frequencies. This is especially true for
very small objects (such as single molecules and aerosols).</p>
<p>Lasers provide one solution to these problems. The beam densities and
coherency are excellent, and the wavelengths are much smaller. The basic
atmospheric LIDAR equation (volumetric target) is given by <span class="math display">$$
P(\lambda,R)=P_0*\frac{c\tau}{2}*\beta(\lambda,R)*\frac{A_r}{R^2}*exp(-2\int_0^R\alpha(\lambda,R)dr)*\xi(\lambda)*\xi(R)

<p>Since the SNR is typically very low, long incoherent averaging is
required to increase it as in radar systems.</p>
<p>Different types of scattering are used for different LIDAR
applications, most common are Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, and
Raman scattering as well as fluorescence. The wavelengths are ideal for
making measurements of smoke and other airborne particles (aerosols),
clouds, and air molecules. A laser typically has a very narrow beam,
which allows the mapping of physical features with very high resolution
compared with radar. In addition, many chemical compounds interact more
strongly at visible wavelengths than at microwaves, resulting in a
stronger image of these materials. Suitable combinations of lasers can
allow for remote mapping of atmospheric contents by looking for
wavelength-dependent changes in the intensity of the returned
signal.</p>
<p>LIDAR has been used extensively for atmospheric research and
meteorology. With the deployment of the global positioning systems (GPS)
in the 1980s precision positioning of aircraft became possible.</p>
<p>GPS-based surveying technology has made airborne surveying and
mapping applications possible and practical. Many have been developed,
using downward-looking LIDAR instruments mounted in aircraft or
satellites.</p>
<h3 id="optical-and-technological-considerations">3.9.2 OPTICAL AND
TECHNOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
<p>There are in general two kinds of LIDARs: “incoherent” or direct
detection of the power return, mainly an amplitude measurement, and
“coherent” which uses the Doppler shift and must keep track of the phase
information in each laser pulse. Coherent systems generally use optical
heterodyne detection which is more sensitive than direct detection and
allows operation at a much lower power levels, but at the expense of
having more complex transceiver requirements.</p>
<p>In both coherent and incoherent LIDARs, there are two types of pulse
models: micropulse and high-energy LIDARs. Micropulse systems have been
developed as a result of the ever-increasing computer power available to
process the sensor data combined with marked advances in laser tech-
nology. Micropulse systems typically operate at power levels that are
“eye safe” meaning that they can operate without any additional safety
precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research where
they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters such as cloud
height, layering and densities of clouds, cloud particle properties,
temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, trace gas concentrations (ozone,
methane, nitrous oxide, etc.), aerosols.</p>
<p>The components of a typical LIDAR are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Laser</strong>. 600e1000 nm lasers are most common for
nonscientific applications. They are inexpensive, but since they can be
focused and easily absorbed by the eye the maximum power is limited by
the need to make them eye-safe. Eye safety is often a requirement for
most applications. A common alternative, the 1550 nm lasers are eye-safe
at much higher power levels since this wavelength is not focused by the
eye, but the detector technology is less advanced in this spectral
region, so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges and
lower accuracies. Airborne topographic mapping LIDARs generally use 1064
nm diodeepumped YAG lasers, while bathymetric systems generally use 532
nm frequency doubled diodeepumped YAG lasers because 532 nm penetrates
water with much less attenuation than does 1064 nm. Variables in the
individual systems include the ability to set the number of passes
required through the gain (YAG, YLF, etc.) and Q-switch speed. Shorter
pulses achieve better target resolution provided the LIDAR receiver
detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner and optics</strong>. How fast images can be
developed is also affected by the speed at which they can be scanned
into the system. There are several different ways to scan the azimuth
and elevation, including dual oscillating plane mirrors, a combination
with a polygon mirror, a dual axes scanner. Optic choices affect the
angular resolution and range that can be detected. A hole- mirror or
beam splitter can be used to collect a laser return signal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Photodetector and receiver electronics</strong>. Two
different photodetector technologies are used in today’s LIDARs:
solid-state photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche photodiodes, or
photomultipliers. The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter
that has to be balanced in a LIDAR design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Position and navigation systems</strong>. LIDAR sensors
mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require
instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation
(pointing angle) of the sensor. GPS and inertial measurement unit
systems are primary types of systems used for this purpose.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="application-of-lidar-systems">3.9.3 APPLICATION OF LIDAR
SYSTEMS</h3>
<p>There are many different applications of LIDAR systems, but we will
concentrate on those primarily in meteorology, which was one of the
earliest applications of LIDAR remote sensing. The first LIDARs were
used for studies of atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and
aerosols. Initially based on rube lasers, LIDARs for meteorology were
constructed shortly after the invention of the laser.</p>
<p>Some modern LIDARs are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Elastic backscatter LIDAR is the simplest form of LIDAR and is
typically used for studies of aerosols and clouds. The backscattered
wavelength is identical to the transmitted wavelength, and the magnitude
of the received signal at a given range depends on the backscatter
coefficient of scatterers at that range and the extinction coefficients
of the scatterers along the path to that range. The extinction
coefficient is typically the quantity of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) is used for range-resolved
measurements of a particular gas in the atmosphere, such as ozone,
carbon dioxide, or water vapor. The LIDAR transmits two wavelengths: an
“on-line” wavelength that is absorbed by the gas of interest and an
off-line wavelength that is not absorbed. The differential absorption
between the two wavelengths is a measure of the concentration of the gas
as a function of range. DIAL LIDARs are essentially dual-wavelength
elastic backscatter LIDARs.</p></li>
<li><p>Raman LIDAR is also used for measuring the concentrations of
atmospheric gases, but can also be used to retrieve aerosol parameters
as well. Raman LIDAR exploits inelastic scattering to single out the gas
of interest from all other atmospheric constituents. A small portion of
the energy of the transmitted light is deposited in the gas during the
scattering process, which shifts the scattered light to a longer
wavelength by an amount that is unique to the species of interest. The
higher the concentration of the gas, the stronger the magnitude of the
backscattered signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Doppler LIDAR is used to measure wind speed along the beam by
measuring the frequency shift of the backscattered signal. Scanning
LIDARs have been used to measure atmospheric wind velocity in a large
three-dimensional core. ESA’s wind mission Atmospheric Dynamics Mission
Aeolus (ADM-Aeolus) will be equipped with a Doppler LIDAR system to
provide global measurements of vertical wind profiles. Doppler LIDAR
systems are now beginning to be successfully applied in the renewable
energy sector to acquire wind speed, turbulence, wind veer, and wind
shear data. Both pulse and continuous wave systems are being used for
these applications.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of spaceborne LIDARs has been very limited because of
the reliability of lasers. So far,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the only LIDAR-based mission is the NASA/CNES cloud-aerosol LIDAR and
infrared pathfinder satellite observation (CALIPSO) mission, which
belongs to the A-TRAIN constellation. CALIPSO combines an active LIDAR
instrument with passive IR and visible imagers to probe the vertical
structure and properties of thin clouds and aerosols over the globe.</p>
<p>CALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006, with the cloud profiling
radar system on the CloudSat satellite. Fig. 3.33 shows an artist’s view
of the CALIPSO mission in the A-TRAIN constellation, a picture and a
drawing of it, and sample LIDAR returns from the sea surface up to 30 km
height. The dark blue regions underneath the high- reflectivity regions
(in pink) correspond to regions where the SNR is too low because of the
increased attenuation of the signal in previous regions. The main
engineering parameters of the CALIPSO LIDAR are listed in Table 3.4.</p>

<h3 id="wind-lidar">WIND LIDAR</h3>
<p>As just mentioned a wind LIDAR is a Doppler LIDAR that uses the
frequency shift of the back- scattered signal to determine the wind
velocity. This concept is depicted here in Fig. 3.34 adapted from Dobler
et al., 2002.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lifeodyssey/Figurebed/master/image-00030110135148162.png" alt="image-00030110135148162">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image-00030110135148162</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This coherent Doppler wind LIDAR measures the frequency of the beat
signal obtained by optically mixing the return signal with the local
oscillator. As a consequence, both the local oscillator and the return
signal must have narrow bandwidths to have sufficient coherent lengths.
Thus, coherent LIDAR detection relies of the aerosol scattering with
very narrow Doppler broadening meaning the LIDAR wind measurements apply
only to those atmospheric regions with adequate aerosol loading.</p>
<p>Since the Mie scattering due to aerosols is better suited to
frequency analysis than is the molecular Rayleigh scattering the choice
of LIDAR wavelength depends on the expected return signal and the
expected ratio of aerosol-to-molecular backscatter. The molecular
scattering cross-section is proportional to <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sup>−4</sup></span>, and the aerosol
signal is proportional to between <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sup>−2</sup></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sup>+1</sup></span>, depending on the
wavelength and particle size and shape.</p>
<p>Even if the aerosol returns decrease with increasing wavelength, the
molecular background de- creases much faster, so that the
aerosol-to-molecular backscatter ratio becomes more favorable to the
measurement. Therefore, longer wavelengths are desirable to minimize the
influence of molecular (Rayleigh) scattering. Coherent Doppler LIDARs
use laser wavelengths between 1 and 11 mm.</p>
<h4 id="vector-wind-velocity-determination">Vector Wind Velocity
Determination</h4>
<p>Vector wind measurements require radial velocity measurements from
three independent “lines-of- sight” meaning you must have three LIDARs.
If it can be assumed that there is no vertical velocity (W 1⁄4 0), then
only two LIDARs are needed. If horizontal homogeneity of the wind field
can be assumed, then a LIDAR beam scanning technique can be used to
determine the wind velocity.</p>
<p>The two main techniques are the velocity azimuth display (VAD) which
is a conical scan LIDAR beam at a fixed elevation angle, and the Doppler
beam swinging (DBS) which is a LIDAR pointing in the vertical which is
tilted east and tilted north. These two methods are graphically
displayed in Fig. 3.35.</p>

Wind LIDAR</h5>
<p>Direct Detection Doppler (DDL) uses incoherent detection to measure
the spectrum of returned sig-nals. DDL can use aerosol/molecular
scattering and/or resonance fluorescence to measure the wind from the
ground to the upper atmosphere. There are several different ways to do
the spectral analysis for the DDL method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resonance fluorescence Doppler LIDAR uses the atmospheric atomic or
molecular absorption lines as the frequency analyzer/discriminator.</li>
<li>Direct detection Doppler LIDAR is based on molecular absorption edge
filter, e.g., iodine (I2) vapor filter, Na or K magnetooptic
filter.</li>
<li>Direct detection Doppler LIDAR is based on optical interferometer
edge-filter, e.g., FabryePerot etalon transmission edge.</li>
<li>Direct detection Doppler LIDAR is based on fringe patter imaging of
an optical interferometer, e.g., FPI imaging.</li>

<h5 id="lidar-wind-summary">LIDAR Wind Summary</h5>
<p>Doppler wind techniques measure the wind velocity along the LIDAR

<p>The results showed that different FMs can have quite different
effects on the computed Rrs?λ?, and, in particular, the effects are not
necessarily uni- form. For this synthetic data set and for the six FMs
evalu- ated, G88 and P05 provided the best estimates of Rrs?λ? for the
given IOPs at 350, 440, and 550 nm. Additionally, G88 and P05 performed
similarly in both the oceanic and coastal conditions, and were
relatively weakly influenced by the change in particle PF. M02 also
provided good estimation but only at 440 nm, and L04 performed well only
in the oceanic condition.</p>
<p>In the coastal sub-dataset, QAA and GIOP combined with G88 or P05
provided slightly better quality IOPs compared with the other four FMs.
Compared with GIOP in the coastal condition, QAA in the coastal con-
dition combined with G88 or P05 always performed better at retrieving
a?λ? but was weaker at retrieving bbp?λ?. It must be noted that only
effective retrievals from each FM-GIOP were considered for comparison;
about 18%–25% of retrievals from GIOP were filtered out in advance due
to bad performance.</p>
